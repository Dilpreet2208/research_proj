How Does Quantization Affect Multilingual LLMs?,4,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03211,The research addresses the lack of understanding of the impact of widely used quantization techniques on the performance of multilingual LLMs across different languages and tasks. It specifically investigates whether automatic metrics accurately reflect the performance degradation caused by quantization in diverse languages and whether the degradation is uniform across languages or tasks.,The research faced challenges in obtaining human feedback on performance cost across numerous languages and diverse tasks.  Handling the disparity in resources (training data) for various languages and the different characteristics of Latin versus non-Latin script languages presented significant methodological hurdles. The diverse nature of the benchmarks added complexities.,The research does not definitively establish the correlation between training data size and performance degradation because training data sizes were not released for the models used. The study is also limited to the model families used.,The study is limited to four SOTA multilingual LLMs. The findings might not generalize to all LLMs.  The research acknowledges limitations in evaluating under-represented languages due to availability of benchmark data and human annotators.,"1.

Do Multilingual Language Models Think Better in English?,38,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01223,The primary problem is the suboptimal performance of multilingual LLMs when prompted in languages other than English.  The reliance on external MT systems in the translate-test method introduces a potential confounding factor related to the additional data involved in training those external systems.,"The main challenge is determining whether improvements seen in translate-test are solely due to external resources or reflect limitations in how LLMs use their multilingual knowledge.  Evaluating across different model sizes, tasks and languages, and comparing against a high-performing external MT system also presented methodological challenges. The computational cost of self-translation is significantly higher than direct inference.","The research does not directly address improving the efficiency of the self-translate method. Although it notes that instruction-tuned models might improve this, it doesn't explore or test this.","Self-translate is slower than direct inference due to the added translation step.  The datasets used were created via human translation, potentially creating evaluation artifacts.  The study did not explore alternative prompting methods or training techniques to fully unlock multilingual potential within LLMs, only focusing on a single intermediate inference step.","Ahuja et al., 2023.

Zhang et al., 2023. Prompting large language model for machine translation: A case study.","Multilingual language models (LLMs) often underperform on non-English languages.  Translate-test, a common approach, uses an external machine translation (MT) system to translate input to English before inference. This improvement is suspected to stem from the additional data used to train the MT system, rather than inherent LLM capabilities. The research aims to investigate whether LLMs can leverage their multilingual abilities without an external MT system.","The research introduces ""self-translate,"" a method where the LLM itself translates the input into English before performing the task.  Experiments were conducted on five tasks (XCOPA, XStoryCloze, XNLI, PAWS-X, MGSM) across seven models (XGLM 564M, 1.7B, 2.9B, 7.5B; LLaMA 7B, 13B, 30B).  Direct inference (no translation) and self-translate were compared, and results were analyzed for different model sizes and language resources.  Additionally, performance was compared to using a state-of-the-art external MT system (NLLB).","Self-translate consistently outperforms direct inference across all tasks and models, indicating LLMs cannot fully utilize their multilingual capabilities without intermediate steps.  This effect is more pronounced in larger models and high-resource languages.  While external MT systems still outperform self-translate, the gap narrows as model size increases, suggesting that advanced LLMs might eventually eliminate the need for external translation.  Cross-lingual transfer capabilities within LLMs exist but are not fully leveraged in direct inference.","The findings highlight the need for improved multilingual capabilities in LLMs and methods to leverage them efficiently. This has implications for applications relying on multilingual LLMs, such as cross-lingual question answering, common sense reasoning, and machine translation, potentially leading to improvements in these areas.","This research directly addresses the core of your research topic by investigating multilingual performance in LLMs, specifically focusing on cross-lingual prompting for tasks like common sense reasoning.  The findings on self-translate, the comparison with external MT systems, and the analysis of performance across different languages and model sizes are highly relevant to understanding the limitations and potential of multilingual LLMs for code generation and commonsense reasoning.  The discussion of failures and limitations can inform future research directions in this area."

Most language technologies struggle with code-mixed data, a common phenomenon in multilingual communities.
2. Social media is a rich source of code-mixed data, requiring NLP attention.
3. Pretrained language models (PLMs) offer potential for handling code-mixed data, but their behavior needs investigation.
4. The impact of pretraining languages on downstream PLM performance with code-mixed data is unclear.","1. Sentiment analysis was chosen as the downstream task.
2. Seven pretrained language models (PLMs) were used, categorized by pretraining data: monolingual, multilingual, Indic, and African.
3. Code-mixed datasets in six languages (Hindi-English, Tamil-English, Malayalam-English, Kannada-English, and two Nigerian Pidgin) were used.
4. Models were evaluated in two settings: after finetuning on code-mixed data and in a zero-shot setting (finetuned on monolingual data then tested on code-mixed data).
5. Analysis included examining model performance based on the composition of languages in the code-mixed data (mostly Hindi vs. mostly English).
6. Additional experiments were conducted on named entity recognition (NER), sarcasm detection, and universal dependency parsing (UDPoS) tasks to compare results and find common trends.
7. A language identification (LID) model was used to analyze language composition in the code-mixed data.","1. Pretraining languages have minimal impact on PLM performance when finetuned on code-mixed data.
2. In the zero-shot setting, pretraining languages significantly affect performance, indicating the importance of relevant languages in pretraining.
3. PLM performance differs on mostly-Hindi vs mostly-English examples within code-mixed datasets.
4. Similar performance across models was observed on different downstream tasks (NER, sarcasm detection, and UDPoS), suggesting the observations are not limited to sentiment analysis.","1. The findings contribute to a better understanding of how to build robust PLMs for code-mixed data, which is crucial for developing accurate language technologies in multilingual settings.

The insights can guide resource allocation in code-mixed NLP towards areas like resource-efficient model development and data augmentation.","This research paper is highly relevant to your research project on multilingual performance and understanding of multi or cross-lingual language prompts for LLMs in the context of code generation or commonsense reasoning.  The paper directly investigates the effects of multilingual pretraining on downstream tasks, which is central to understanding multilingual capabilities of LLMs.  The analysis of performance on code-mixed data is especially relevant to the challenge of handling complex linguistic inputs, such as those encountered in code generation and commonsense reasoning tasks where diverse or nuanced prompts might be used.  The findings about the relative importance of pretraining languages in finetuned vs zero-shot settings offer valuable insights for designing effective prompts and training strategies for multi- or cross-lingual prompts in LLMs. The focus on various downstream tasks beyond sentiment analysis further demonstrates the broad implications of the study for your research project."

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) excel at linguistic and factual knowledge acquisition but struggle with implicit commonsense knowledge.
2. Existing methods for injecting commonsense knowledge into PLMs either rely on limited knowledge graphs or fail to capture implicit commonsense reasoning.
3. The goal is to develop a framework that effectively transfers commonsense knowledge from a neural commonsense knowledge model to a general-purpose PLM, improving commonsense reasoning without extensive supervision.","1. **Commonsense Knowledge Extraction:** Extract commonsense knowledge (in textual form) from a neural commonsense knowledge model (e.g., COMET) using general text as queries.
2. **Commonsense Knowledge Injection:** Refine the PLM using two self-supervised objectives:
    * Commonsense Text Infilling: Mask spans in commonsense tuples (natural text + commonsense inference) and train the model to reconstruct them.
    * Commonsense Relation Prediction: Train the model to distinguish valid commonsense inferences from carefully constructed distractors.
3. **Model Refinement:** Train the target PLM (e.g., T5) on the generated training data, aligning human language with underlying commonsense knowledge.","1. The proposed commonsense knowledge transfer framework consistently improves PLM performance on downstream tasks requiring commonsense reasoning.
2. The improvement is more significant in few-shot settings, suggesting better transfer to downstream tasks with limited supervision.

4. The multi-tasking approach with both commonsense text infilling and relation prediction improves model performance compared to sequential training.
5. The approach generalizes to different PLMs (tested on T5 and BART).","1. Enhancing the commonsense reasoning capabilities of PLMs across a wide range of NLP tasks.
2. Improving few-shot performance on downstream tasks requiring commonsense, reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets.
3. Building more robust and generalizable NLP models capable of handling real-world scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information.","This research paper is highly relevant to your research topic on multilingual performance and understanding of multi/cross-lingual language prompts for LLMs in code generation or commonsense reasoning.  The paper directly addresses the challenge of improving commonsense reasoning in PLMs, a crucial aspect of enhancing the understanding and generation of code and reasoning in multiple languages. The proposed framework for commonsense knowledge transfer could be adapted and extended to handle multilingual data, potentially improving the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs for code generation and commonsense reasoning tasks. The findings on few-shot learning are also valuable for scenarios with limited multilingual training data.  The paper's focus on improving implicit reasoning abilities is particularly relevant to tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such as code generation and commonsense reasoning, which often necessitate understanding implicit information."
